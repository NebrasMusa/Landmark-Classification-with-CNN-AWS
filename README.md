# Landmark-Classification-with-CNN-AWS
**Landmark Classifier CNN** - AI that automatically detects landmarks in photos when GPS is missing, using PyTorch and custom CNNs to help photo apps auto-tag and organize images by location.


üìñ Project Overview
This project solves an important problem for photo services: automatically detecting landmarks in images when location data is missing. Many photos don't have GPS information due to privacy concerns or camera limitations, making it impossible to organize them by location.

üéØ The Solution
I built an AI system that can look at any photo and recognize famous landmarks, automatically suggesting where the photo was taken. This helps photo apps automatically tag and organize pictures without manual work.

üõ†Ô∏è What I Built
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared landmark images for training

Custom CNN Architecture: Designed a neural network from scratch

Model Training: Taught the AI to recognize 50 different landmarks

Performance Optimization: Improved accuracy through better design

Deployment Ready: Created a model that can be used in real apps

üß† Technical Approach
Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition

Implemented data augmentation to make the model more robust

Applied transfer learning principles

Achieved high accuracy in landmark classification

üí° Impact
This technology enables photo services to:

Automatically tag photos with location

Organize photo libraries by place

Suggest relevant tags and categories

Provide better user experiences

üöÄ Skills Demonstrated
